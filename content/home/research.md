My research focuses at the confluence of climate science, geographic information systems, and machine learning.  Specifically, I am interested in how I can leverage so-called “big data” to answer pertinent research questions related to thunderstorms and climate change, and how this interplay may influence the spatiotemporal dimensions of affiliated impacts to humans and the environment.  My work benefits from the maturation of remotely-sensed precipitation datasets, recent advances in image processing and classification technologies, and improvements in regional weather modeling, supported, in part, by increases in computational processing capacity and storage.
