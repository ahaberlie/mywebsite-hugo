# Biography

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Geographic and Atmospheric Sciences at Northern Illinois University.  Broadly, I am a climate scientist who uses geographic information systems, machine learning, and weather models to explore topics related to deep, moist convection (i.e., thunderstorms) and their affiliated hazards.
