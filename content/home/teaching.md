As a graduate teaching assistant, and later an instructor, I had the exciting opportunity to engage students in the study of a wide range of topics in physical geography and the atmospheric sciences.  In particular, my early graduate career teaching responsibilities included relatively small (10 – 20 students) laboratory courses with students from varied educational backgrounds and majors (GEOG 102 – Introduction to Physical Geography Laboratory), as well as laboratories, practicums, and evaluation associated with upper-level, required, courses for meteorology majors (MET 300 – Physical Meteorology; MET 320 – Synoptic Meteorology; MET 421 –Advanced Synoptic Meteorology; MET 444 – Mesoscale Meteorology).  Later in my graduate career, I was the instructor of record for a larger (40 – 50 students) general education course that introduced students to the atmospheric sciences (GEOG 105 – Introduction to the Atmosphere).  Additionally, I led a weather forecasting practicum course for approximately 15 junior- and senior-level meteorology students (MET 475 – Practicum in Weather Analysis and Forecasting).
